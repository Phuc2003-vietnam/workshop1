### Problem statement

Let’s say that our business requirements call for 99.5% uptime and have the ability to serve high number of request at peak time with optimized cost. In other words, it is allowed to be down no more than 44 hours in any given 12-month period. The total availability of a system of sequentially connected components is the product of individual availabilities. Let’s for example assume that individual servers that host our web and application tiers have 90% availability and the server hosting our database has 99%. For simplicity’s sake, let’s also assume that these availability numbers include hardware, OS, software, and connectivity.
